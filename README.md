# RT-EGARCH
This program aims at providing the R codes of the simulation and estimation of Real time EGARCH models in our working paper.

# Notes
1) RTEGARCH.simu for simulating the data from RT-EGARCH(1,0) and RT-EGARCH(1,1).

2) eps.Newton1X for approximating the innovation \varepsilon_t by Newton method in RT-EGARCH(1,X).

3) QMLE_EGARCH1X for estimating the RT-EGARCH(1,X) by MLE.


 # Please be patient since the estimation process will spend more time due to the extra  Newton process.
